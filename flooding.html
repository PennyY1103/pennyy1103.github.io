                                    Flood events can cause serious damage, such as infrastructure destruction and water system pollution. 
                                    To mitigate risks to people and property, it's crucial to quantify the impacts of flood events. 
                                    However, many of the online flood reports and maps often lack detailed documentation or visualization of specific regions/areas affected by flood events, especially for relatively small-scale events (occurring in small regions/short time periods). 
                                    Therefore, developing a more precise approach to assess the extent of flood events is needed.`;

                                      Satellite data, particularly from Sentinel-2 with its 10-meter resolution, provides a powerful tool for observing and analyzing flood events in detail. 
                                      While weather conditions such as heavy cloud cover during flood events can be challenging,the use of satellite imagery and machine learning techniques remains valuable. 
                                      Satellite imagery offers broad and near real-time coverage that helps enhance the ability to monitor and assess flooded areas.

                                        The decision to use K-means clustering is based on three crucial factors: the small dataset size (69 images), the absence of ground truth for the flooded areas, and the unique visual characteristics of the flooded areas (brown water bodies caused by sediment). 
                                        K-means clustering algorithm groups data points based on similarity.

                                    Based on the analysis of the clustered images, the combination of NDWI mask and PCA outputs the best result. 
                                    Therefore, further analysis is conducted by comparing the best result and NDWI mask.
                                    Because optimization of K-means clustering algorithms are applied to images individually, the selected optimal n_components and n_clusters clusters can vary between images. 
                                    To automatically identify the cluster representing the flooded area, NDWI mask is used. 
                                    The overlap between the NDWI mask and each cluster is calculated, with the cluster showing the highest overlap being identified as the flooded area.

                                    The New England region has experienced a significant number of recent flood events, with 1,107 observations highlighting the challenges of inland and coastal flooding. 
                                    Therefore, developing effective methods for assessing flooded areas is critical. 
                                    However, the weather conditions during flood events, particularly heavy cloud cover, pose challenges in collecting a large number of high-quality Sentinel-2 images. 
                                    Additionally, due to the timing of Sentinel-2, flood events may not be captured. 
                                    Based on these flood event observations, 379 images are collected, and only 69 of those are ideal.</p>

                                    The analysis of the default K-means clustering algorithm across various images reveals that environmental characteristics significantly influence the results. 
                                    When the features in an image are primarily flooded areas and green land, the default K-means algorithm can extract the majority of the flooded regions with relatively small noisy pixels. 
                                    However, in more complex environments, optimizing the algorithm becomes crucial, as the flooded areas are more likely to be mixed with other noisy pixels.</p>

                                    Different optimization approaches have different results. 
                                    For instance, when combining the NDWI mask with PCA, NDWI tends to dominate the outcome, having a strong influence on the result. 
                                    Additionally, the same optimization technique can produce different effects depending on the environmental characteristics of the images. 
                                    These results need to further investigated to understand the process and improve the optimization approach used.

                <p>
                    <strong>Firstly</strong>, the current approach to extracting major rivers from flowline datasets can be improved. Samuel Roy, a scientist from USGS, suggests that stream order selection is helpful in identifying major rivers. By adding this modification, the flowline mask in the optimization process might be more helpful.<br>
                    <strong>Secondly</strong>, the optimization process can be improved by exploring various ways to combine the features (NDWI and flowline) and techniques (StandardScaler and PCA) currently in use. Each combination of these elements can produce different results, and selecting the optimal combination is crucial for enhancing the model's performance.<br>
                    <strong>Thirdly</strong>, one of the initial datasets included in this proposal is the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Because flood event observations often come with elevation values, integrating DEM data can provide valuable insights. However, high-water marks from the STN (Short-Term Network) dataset need to be carefully processed. Some locations may have multiple high-water marks with different elevation values. Discussion with a professional will be necessary to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
