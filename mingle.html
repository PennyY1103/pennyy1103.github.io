                                     We've discussed several problems that kids face today, including mental health issues, bullying, and conflicts with family and friends. 
                                     Given that this project was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also considered how the pandemic has impacted kids' well-being and learning. 
                                     For example, kids have struggled with connecting with their peers as easily through class. <br>
                                     Given this situation, we thought it would be worthwhile to develop an application that helps kids find balance and deal with the challenges of our world by connecting with their peers. 
                                     This app would be particularly relevant in today's context, with the heavy reliance on online friendships and communication.`;
